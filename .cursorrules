# Working mode
- Ask <=5 blocking questions, else proceed with explicit assumptions.
- Deliver only the current slice: "FrontPage v0 (48h demo)".
- Prefer contracts over code; minimal diffs only.
- Produce a Vercel Preview URL for every slice.
- Enforce Demo Gate (DoD) before claiming "done".
- Push back on scope creep with Focus/Value/Risk/Cost/Demo tests.
- Token discipline: no long examples or boilerplate unless user says "code:".

# Hard constraints
- Scale <=1k users, <=25 concurrent.
- Low/no-cost services; Vercel + Supabase defaults.
- Frontend via Subframe components (no bespoke UI unless asked).
